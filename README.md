##Introduction

CoreFlightAnimation is a naturally built on top of CoreAnimation APIs. Featuring seamless intergration into existing animations in existing projects, `CABasicAnimation`, and `CAAnimationGroup` are enhanced 46+ parametric easings, animation caching, and sequencing with other animations. 

Under the hood, CoreFlightAnimation uses `CAKeyframeAnimation` to dynamically interpolate based on the presentation layer's values when the animation is applied. Unique to CoreFlightAnimation is that you can define prowperty animations with different easing curves, group them together, and watch the group synchronize them dynamically from the current state, even in mid-flight.

##Basic Use 

Since the framework was built mimicking CoreAnimation APIs it is very simple integration wherever `CABasicAnimation`, and `CAAnimationGroup` are used as the follow nearly identical syntax. Before diving into some more advanced features, take a quick look at how the `CoreAnimation` compares to the `CoreFlightAnimation`. 

##### CoreAnimation vs. CoreFlightAnimation

```swift
let positionAnimation 					= CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
positionAnimation.duration 				= 0.5
positionAnimation.toValue 				= NSValue(CGPoint : toCenterPoint)
positionAnimation.fromValue 			= NSValue(CGPoint : view.layer.position)
positionAnimation.fillMode              = kCAFillModeForwards
positionAnimation.timingFunction        = CAMediaTimingFunction(name:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)

let boundsAnimation 					= CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "bounds")
boundsAnimation.duration 				= 0.5
boundsAnimation.toValue 				= NSValue(CGRect : toBounds)
boundsAnimation.fromValue 				= NSValue(CGRect : view.layer.bounds)
boundsAnimation.fillMode              	= kCAFillModeForwards
boundsAnimation.timingFunction        	= CAMediaTimingFunction(name:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)

let animationGroup 						= CAAnimationGroup()
animationGroup.duration 				= 0.5
animationGroup.removedOnCompletion   	= false
animationGroup.animations 				= [positionAnimation, boundsAnimation]

view.layer.addAnimation(animationGroup, forKey: "PositionAnimationKey")
view.frame = toFrame
```
Below is the equivalent in `CoreFlightAnimation`.

```swift
let positionAnimation 					= FABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
positionAnimation.duration 				= 0.5
positionAnimation.toValue 				= NSValue(CGPoint : toCenterPoint)
positionAnimation.easingFuntion         = .OutCubic

let boundsAnimation 					= FABasicAnimation(keyPath: "bounds")
boundsAnimation.duration 				= 0.5
boundsAnimation.toValue 				= NSValue(CGRect : toBounds)
boundsAnimation.easingFuntion          = .OutCubic
    
let animationGroup = FABasicAnimationGroup()
animationGroup.animations = [positionAnimation, boundsAnimation]

view.layer.addAnimation(animationGroup, forKey: "PositionAnimationKey")
view.frame = toFrame
```

Follow the following 4 steps to integrate `CoreFlightAnimation` into existing projects:

1. Change `CABasicAnimation` to `FABasicAnimation`, technically the letter **C** to **F**
2. Change `CAAnimationGroup` to `FABasicAnimationGroup`, same as previous :)
3. Use defaults values the following properties, which are now configured by CoreFlightAnimation:
	- *removedOnCompletion*
	- *fillMode*
	- *fromValue* 
4. Change `timingFunction` property to `easingFuntion`, and use one of 46+ enumerated options :)

Simple as that!

###Caching Animations

The cool thing about this framework is that you can register animations for a specific key, and trigger them as needed based on the Animation Key it registered against. By defining multiple states up front, we can toggle them when needed, and it will synchronize / interpolate all the values accordingly when applied.

####Register Animation

FABasicAnimation allows for caching animations, and reusing them at a later point. for the purpose of this example lets first create an animation key to register a position animation against

```swift
struct AnimationKeys {
    static let PositionAnimation  = "PositionAnimation"
}
```

Now that the key is defined, create lets create an animation.

```swift
let positionAnimation 					= FABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
positionAnimation.toValue 				= NSValue(CGPoint : toCenterPoint)
positionAnimation.duration 				= 0.5
positionAnimation.easingFuntion         = .EaseOutCubic
``` 

Once the animation is created, we then need to register it with to the view with out defined animation key.

```swift
// Register Animation Groups
view.registerAnimation(positionAnimation, forKey: AnimationKeys.PositionAnimation)
```

**Note**: Registering an FABasicAnimationGroup works the exact same way as the registering an FABasicAnimation documented above. Technically, when registering a simple FABasicAnimation, the framework wraps the animation in an FABasicAnimationGroup anyways for syncronization purposes.

####Applying Registered Animations

To apply the animation state, all we have to do is call the following. This will synchronize the current presentations values with a prior animation, apply the relative remaining time of travel, and will apply the animation to the final destination.

```swift
view.applyAnimation(forKey: AnimationKeys.PositionAnimation)
```

If you want to just apply the final values of a registered animation without actually performing the animation, just call the following

```swift
view.applyAnimation(forKey: AnimationKeys.PositionAnimation, animated : false)
```
